## Things that intrigues me 

### Microtests

The focus on branch testing intrigues me, the rest of the properties I usually have covered in the behavioral and unit tests I write.

Five important properties of microtests are:

1.Externality.
1.Source-only relationship to app.
1.Branchy focus.
1.Active confirmation.
1.Small size and high speed.
