## Things that intrigues me 

### Microtests

The focus on branch testing intrigues me, the rest of the properties I usually have covered in the behavioral and unit tests I write.

Five important properties of microtests are:

1.Externality.
1.Source-only relationship to app.
1.Branchy focus.
1.Active confirmation.
1.Small size and high speed.

### Personal Software Process (PSP)

What if you could:
* Estimate precisely how long it would take you to complete a assignment/task/story
* Write code with significant less defects/bugs
* Challenge deadlines backed by data
 
The benefits of PSP sounds amazing but it does require a lot of structure and extra work for you as a developer. So the cost of getting started may be too high even thou they rewards sounds amazing.
