# Heuristics
A mental shortcut than can ease the cognitive load of making a decision

## When designing use real data
Use real data as soon as possible in your process, the assumptions you make while designing will be challenged and corrected much faster, leading less rework leading to faster deliveries.  
-- Nick Tunes

## Understand the problem your code solves
All code must justify itself. When we write code we should be able to describe in words what problems it solves. This is also true for implementing design patterns or importing libraries
